# wordCount

Given a text file and an integer N, print the N most frequent and N least frequent words occurring in the text file along with their frequencies. If there are more than N words with the same frequency you may pick N of them at random. The path to the file and the integer N will be passed as arguments to your program. The output is expected to be in the form:

Most frequent
(word:count), (word:count), (word:count)
Least frequent
(word:count), (word:count), (word:count)

As an example, for the attached text file input1.txt and N=3 the expected output would be:
Most frequent
(is:8), (to:7), (not:7)
Least frequent
(an:1), (are:1), (by:1)
